How this process is controlled spatially and temporally so that the right cargo is delivered to the right destination at the right time remains poorly understood. To address this question, it is essential to characterize and analyze the molecular machinery and spatiotemporal behavior of intracellular transport. To this end, we developed related computational image models. Specifically, to study the molecular machinery of intracellular transport, we developed anisotropic spatial density kernels for reconstruction and segmentation of related super-resolution STORM (stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy) images. To study the spatiotemporal behavior of intracellular transport, we developed hidden Markov models and principal component analysis for representation and analysis of movement of individual transported cargoes. We validated and benchmarked the image models using simulated and actual experimental images. The models and related computational analysis methods developed in this study are general and can be used for studying molecular machinery and spatiotemporal dynamics of other cellular processes.},

	abstract = {Intracellular transport is the process of distributing and collecting materials, often packaged in different forms of cargoes, to fulﬁll changing structural and functional needs within the cell. Although the molecular machinery for intracellular transport has largely been identiﬁed, how this process is regulated globally in space and time remains unclear. In a step towards answering this question, we developed an image-based computational method for characterizing spatiotemporal dynamics of intracellular transport at the whole-cell scale to separate signals of moving and stationary cargoes. Speciﬁcally, we extended an algorithm that we developed previously for removing background ﬂuorescence of static images. This separation allows us to extract from time-lapse images the global pattern of cargo movement without single particle tracking of individual cargoes. Based on this separation, we characterized the spatiotemporal dynamics of intracellular transport in terms of the spatial localization of stationary cargoes and the spatiotemporal patterns of cargo movement, respectively. We ﬁrst tested and validated our methods using synthetic images. We then used our methods to analyze time-lapse images of Lamp1 transport and found different global patterns of transport behavior.},

Here, we employ multi-ﬁdelity Bayesian optimization to obtain the fractional order under various conditions, and we obtain more accurate results compared to previously published data. Moreover, the present method is very eﬃcient as we use different levels of resolution to construct a stochastic surrogate model and quantify its uncertainty. We consider two different problem set ups. In the ﬁrst set up, we obtain variable fractional orders of one-dimensional FADE, considering both synthetic and ﬁeld data. In the second set up, we identify constant fractional orders of two-dimensional FADE using synthetic data. We employ multi-resolution simulations using two-level and three-level Gaussian process regression models to construct the surrogates.},

	abstract = {We propose a new multi-ﬁdelity Gaussian process regression (GPR) approach for prediction of random ﬁelds based on observations of surrogate models or hierarchies of surrogate models. Our method builds upon recent work on recursive Bayesian techniques, in particular recursive co-kriging, and extends it to vector-valued ﬁelds and various types of covariances, including separable and non-separable ones. The framework we propose is general and can be used to perform uncertainty propagation and quantiﬁcation in model-based simulations, multi-ﬁdelity data fusion, and surrogate-based optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed recursive GPR techniques through various examples. Speciﬁcally, we study the stochastic Burgers equation and the stochastic Oberbeck–Boussinesq equations describing natural convection within a square enclosure. In both cases we ﬁnd that the standard deviation of the Gaussian predictors as well as the absolute errors relative to benchmark stochastic solutions are very small, suggesting that the proposed multi-ﬁdelity GPR approaches can yield highly accurate results.},

In this paper, we present a new paradigm of learning partial diﬀerential equations from small data. In particular, we introduce hidden physics models, which are essentially data-eﬃcient learning machines capable of leveraging the underlying laws of physics, expressed by time dependent and nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations, to extract patterns from high-dimensional data generated from experiments. The proposed methodology may be applied to the problem of learning, system identiﬁcation, or data-driven discovery of partial diﬀerential equations. Our framework relies on Gaussian processes, a powerful tool for probabilistic inference over functions, that enables us to strike a balance between model complexity and data ﬁtting. The eﬀectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a variety of canonical problems, spanning a number of scientiﬁc domains, including the Navier-Stokes, Schr¨odinger, KuramotoSivashinsky, and time dependent linear fractional equations. The methodology provides a promising new direction for harnessing the long-standing developments of classical methods in applied mathematics and mathematical physics to design learning machines with the ability to operate in complex domains without requiring large quantities of data.},

By using ﬁltering in Fourier space to remove frequencies associated with immobile components, we are able to measure the protein transport even in the presence of a large fraction (.90\%) of immobile species. We present the background theory, computer simulations, and analysis of measurements on ﬂuorescent microspheres to demonstrate proof of principle, capabilities, and limitations of the method. We demonstrate mapping of ﬂow vectors for mixed samples containing ﬂuorescent microspheres with different emission wavelengths using space time image cross-correlation. We also present results from two-photon laser-scanning microscopy studies of a-actinin/enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein fusion constructs at the basal membrane of living CHO cells. Using space-time image correlation spectroscopy (STICS), we are able to measure protein ﬂuxes with magnitudes of mm/min from retracting lamellar regions and protrusions for adherent cells. We also demonstrate the measurement of correlated directed ﬂows (magnitudes of mm/min) and diffusion of interacting a5 integrin/enhanced cyan ﬂuorescent protein and a-actinin/enhanced yellow ﬂuorescent protein within living CHO cells.

Simulations demonstrate that structural features and diﬀusion properties can be accurately obtained at sub-diﬀraction-limited resolution. We apply our technique to image agarose hydrogels and aqueous lyotropic liquid crystal gels. The heterogeneous pore resolution is improved by up to a factor of 2, and diﬀusion coeﬃcients are accurately obtained through our method compared to diﬀraction-limited ﬂuorescence imaging and single-particle tracking. Moreover, fcsSOFI allows for rapid and high-throughput characterization of porous materials. fcsSOFI could be applied to soft porous environments such hydrogels, polymers, and membranes in addition to hard materials such as zeolites and mesoporous silica.},

Tubules sometimes connect two or more different plastids and can extend over long distances within a cell, observations that suggest that the tubules may function in distribution of molecules within, to and from plastids. In a new application of two-photon excitation (2PE) ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), we separated diffusion of ﬂuorescent molecules from active transport in vivo. We quantiﬁed the velocities of diffusion versus active transport of green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) within plastid tubules and in the cytosol in vivo. GFP moves by 3-dimensional (3-D) diffusion both in the cytosol and plastid tubules, but diffusion in tubules is about 50 times and 100 times slower than in the cytosol and an aqueous solution, respectively. Unexpectedly larger GFP units within plastid tubules exhibited active transport with a velocity of about 0.12 µm/second. Active transport might play an important role in the long-distance distribution of large numbers of molecules within the highly viscous stroma of plastid tubules.},

	abstract = {Measurement of receptor distributions on cell surfaces is one important aspect of understanding the mechanism whereby receptors function. In recent years, scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy has emerged as an excellent tool for making quantitative measurements of cluster sizes and densities. However, the measurements are slow and usually require fixed preparations. Moreover, while the precision is good, the accuracy is limited by the relatively small amount of information in each measurement, such that many are required. Here we present a novel extension of the scanning correlation spectroscopy that solves a number of the present problems. The new technique, which we call image correlation spectroscopy, is based on quantitative analysis of confocal scanning laser microscopy images. Since these can be generated in a matter of a second or so, the measurements become more rapid. The image is collected over a large cell area so that more sampling is done, improving the accuracy. The sacrifice is a lower resolution in the sampling, which leads to a lower precision. This compromise of precision in favor of speed and accuracy still provides an enormous advantage for image correlation spectroscopy over scanning correlation spectroscopy. The present work demonstrates the underlying theory, showing how the principles can be applied to measurements on standard fluorescent beads and changes in distribution of receptors for platelet-derived growth factor on human foreskin fibroblasts.},

The method is computationally cheap and robust and requires no a priori knowledge about the dynamical coefﬁcients, as opposed to other methods. We demonstrate the validity of the method by Monte Carlo simulations and by application to single-molecule tracking data of membrane-anchored proteins in live cells. The results faithfully reproduce those obtained by conventional tracking.

	abstract = {Field and numerical experiments of solute transport through heterogeneous porous and fractured media show that the growth of contaminant plumes may not exhibit constant scaling, and may instead transition between diffusive states (i.e., superdiffusion, subdiffusion, and Fickian diffusion) at various transport scales. These transitions are likely attributed to physical properties of the medium, such as spatial variations in medium heterogeneity. We refer to this transitory dispersive behavior as “transient dispersion”, and propose a variable-index fractional-derivative model (FDM) to describe the underlying transport dynamics. The new model generalizes the standard constant-index FDM which is limited to stationary heterogeneous media. Numerical methods including an implicit Eulerian method (for spatiotemporal transient dispersion) and a Lagrangian solver (for multiscaling dispersion) are utilized to produce variable-index FDM solutions. The variable-index FDM is then applied to describe transient dispersion observed at two field tracer tests and a set of numerical experiments. Results show that 1) uranine transport at the small-scale Grimsel test site transitions from strong subdispersion to Fickian dispersion, 2) transport of tritium at the regional-scale Macrodispersion Experimental (MADE) site transitions from near-Fickian dispersion to strong superdispersion, and 3) the conservative particle transport through regional-scale discrete fracture network transitions from superdispersion to Fickian dispersion. The variable-index model can efficiently quantify these transitions, with the scale index varying linearly in time or space.},

	abstract = {We investigate the spatiotemporal nonlocality underlying fractional-derivative models as a possible explanation for regional-scale anomalous dispersion with heavy tails. Properties of four fractional-order advection–dispersion equation (fADE) models were analyzed and compared systematically, including the space fADEs with either maximally positive or negative skewness, the time fADE with a temporal fractional-derivative 0 {\textless} c {\textless} 1, and the extension of the time fADE with 1 {\textless} c {\textless} 2. Space fADEs describe the dependence of local concentration change on a wide range of spatial zones (i.e., the space nonlocality), while time fADEs describe dynamic mass exchange between mobile and multiple immobile phases and therefore record the temporal history of concentration ‘‘loading” (i.e., the time-nonlocality). We then applied the fADEs as models of anomalous dispersion to four extensively-studied, regional-scale, natural systems, including a hillslope composed of fractured soils, a river with simultaneous active ﬂow zones and various dead-zones, a relatively homogeneous glacioﬂuvial aquifer dominated by stratiﬁed sand and gravel, and a highly heterogeneous alluvial aquifer containing both preferential ﬂowpaths and abundant aquitards. We ﬁnd that the anomalous dispersion observed at each site might not be characterized reasonably or sufﬁciently by previous studies. In particular, the use of the space fADE with less than maximally positive skewness implies a spatial dependence on downstream concentrations that may not be physically realistic for solute transport in watershed catchments and rivers (where the inﬂuence of dead-zones on solute transport can be described by a temporal, not spatial, fractional model). Field-scale transport studies show that large ranges of solute displacement can be described by a space nonlocal, fractional-derivative model, and long waiting times can be described efﬁciently by a time-nonlocal, fractional model. The unknown quantitative relationship between the nonlocal parameters and the heterogeneity, and the similarity in concentration proﬁles that are solutions to the different nonlocal transport models, all demonstrate the importance of distinguishing the representative nonlocality (time and/or space) for any given regional-scale anomalous dispersion process.},

	abstract = {The Golgi apparatus lies at the heart of the secretory pathway where it receives, modiﬁes and sorts protein cargo to the proper intracellular or extracellular location. Although this secretory function is highly conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom, the structure of the Golgi complex is arranged very differently among species. In particular, Golgi membranes in vertebrate cells are integrated into a single compact entity termed the Golgi ribbon that is normally localized in the perinuclear area and in close vicinity to the centrosomes. This organization poses a challenge for cell division when the single Golgi ribbon needs to be partitioned into the two daughter cells. To ensure faithful inheritance in the progeny, the Golgi ribbon is divided in three consecutive steps in mitosis, namely disassembly, partitioning and reassembly. However, the structure of the Golgi ribbon is only present in higher animals and Golgi disassembly during mitosis is not ubiquitous in all organisms. Therefore, there must be unique reasons to build up the Golgi in this particular conformation and to preserve it over generations. In this review, we ﬁrst highlight the diversity of the Golgi architecture in different organisms and revisit the concept of the Golgi ribbon. Following on, we discuss why the ribbon is needed and how it forms in vertebrate cells. Lastly, we conclude with likely purposes of mitotic ribbon disassembly and further propose mechanisms by which it regulates mitosis.},

Golgi complex size likely is regulated to meet the demands of each function, and this may involve differential changes of its distinct subdomains. Nevertheless, the primary size change is elongation of the Golgi ribbon-like network as occurs during Golgi complex doubling for mitosis and during differentiation involving upregulated secretion. One hypothesis states that Golgi complex size is set by the abundance of secretory cargo and Golgi complex components that, through binding vesicle coat complexes, drive vesicle coat formation to alter Golgi complex inﬂux and efﬂux. Regulation of transport factors controlling Golgi membrane trafﬁc is also observed and may control Golgi complex size, but more work is needed to directly link these events to Golgi complex size regulation, especially during differentiation of specialized cell types.},

	abstract = {The Golgi complex is the central organelle of the secretory pathway. It undergoes dynamic changes during the cell cycle, but how it acquires and maintains its complex structure is unclear. To address this question, we have used laser nanosurgery to deplete BSC1 cells of the Golgi complex and have monitored its biogenesis by quantitative time-lapse microscopy and correlative electron microscopy. After Golgi depletion, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export is inhibited and the number of ER exit sites (ERES) is reduced and does not increase for several hours. Occasional fusion of small post-ER carriers to form the first larger structures triggers a rapid and drastic growth of Golgi precursors, due to the capacity of these structures to attract more carriers by microtubule nucleation and to stimulate ERES biogenesis. Increasing the chances of postER carrier fusion close to ERES by depolymerizing microtubules results in the acceleration of Golgi and ERES biogenesis. Taken together, on the basis of our results, we propose a self-organizing principle of the early secretory pathway that integrates Golgi biogenesis, ERES biogenesis and the organization of the microtubule network by positive-feedback loops.},

Here we review PIV and optical ﬂow, focusing on the accuracy and efﬁciency of these methods in the context of cellular biophysics. Although optical ﬂow is not as common, a relatively simple implementation of this method can outperform PIV and is easily augmented to extract additional biophysical/chemical information such as local vorticity or net polymerization rates from speckle microscopy.},

In some such cases it is useful to guarantee that orders of accuracy are not degraded: assuming the approximating values of the function are known with an accuracy of order O(hr), where h is the mesh size, an accuracy of O(hr) is desired in the value of the derivatives of f . Diﬀerentiation of interpolating polynomials does not achieve this goal since, as shown in this text, n-fold diﬀerentiation of an interpolating polynomial of any degree ≥ (r − 1) obtained from function values containing errors of order O(hr) generally gives rise to derivative errors of order O(hr−n); other existing diﬀerentiation algorithms suﬀer from similar degradations in the order of accuracy. In this paper we present a new algorithm, the LDC method (low degree Chebyshev), which, using noisy function values of a function f on a (possibly irregular) grid, produces approximate values of derivatives f (n) (n = 1, 2 . . . ) with limited loss in the order of accuracy. For example, for (possibly nonsmooth) O(hr) errors in the values of an underlying inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable function, the LDC loss in the order of accuracy is “vanishingly small”: derivatives of smooth functions are approximated by the LDC algorithm with an accuracy of order O(hr ) for all r {\textless} r. The algorithm is very fast and simple; a variety of numerical results we present illustrate the theory and demonstrate the eﬃciency of the proposed methodology.},

	abstract = {Background: Endocytosis allows the import and distribution of cargo into a series of endosomes with distinct morphological and biochemical characteristics. Our current understanding of endocytic cargo trafﬁcking is based on the kinetics of net cargo transport between endosomal compartments without considering individual endosomes. However, endosomes form a dynamic network of membranes undergoing fusion and ﬁssion, thereby continuously exchanging and redistributing cargo. The macroscopic kinetic properties, i.e., the properties of the endosomal network as a whole, result from the collective behaviors of many individual endosomes, a problem so far largely unaddressed.
Results: Here, we developed a general theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of cargo distributions in the endosomal network. We combined the theory with quantitative experiments to study how the macroscopic kinetic properties of the endosomal network emerge from microscopic processes at the level of individual endosomes. We compared our theory predictions to experimental data in which dynamic distributions of endocytosed low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were quantiﬁed.
Conclusions: Our theory can quantitatively describe the observed cargo distributions as a function of time. Remarkably, the theory allows determining microscopic kinetic parameters such as the fusion rate between endosomes from still images of cargo distributions at different times of internalization. We show that this method is robust and sensitive because cargo distributions result from an average over many stochastic events in many cells. Our results provide theoretical and experimental support to the ‘‘funnel model’’ of endosome progression and suggest that the conversion of early to late endosomes is the major mode of LDL trafﬁcking.},

	abstract = {Phase separating systems that are maintained away from thermodynamic equilibrium via molecular processes represent a class of active systems, which we call active emulsions. These systems are driven by external energy input for example provided by an external fuel reservoir. The external energy input gives rise to novel phenomena that are not present in passive systems. For instance, concentration gradient can spatially organise emulsions and cause novel droplet size distributions. Another example are active droplets that are subject to chemical reactions, so their nucleation and size can be controlled and they can spontaneously divide. In this review we discuss the physics of phase separation and emulsions and show how the concepts that governs such phenomena can be extended to capture the physics of active emulsions. This physics is relevant to the spatial organisation of the biochemistry in living cells and for the development novel applications in chemical engineering.},

	abstract = {Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and its extension based on time-windows have been shown to greatly improve the effectiveness of recovering smooth ensemble solutions from noisy particle data. However, to successfully de-noise any molecular system, a large number of measurements still need to be provided. In order to achieve a better eﬃciency in processing time-dependent ﬁelds, we have combined POD with a well-established signal processing technique, wavelet-based thresholding. In this novel hybrid procedure, the wavelet ﬁltering is applied within the POD domain and referred to as WAVinPOD. The algorithm exhibits promising results when applied to both synthetically generated signals and particle data. In this work, the simulations compare the performance of our new approach with standard POD or wavelet analysis in extracting smooth proﬁles from noisy velocity and density ﬁelds. Numerical examples include molecular dynamics and dissipative particle dynamics simulations of unsteady force- and shear-driven liquid ﬂows, as well as phase separation phenomenon. Simulation results conﬁrm that WAVinPOD preserves the dimensionality reduction obtained using POD, while improving its ﬁltering properties through the sparse representation of data in wavelet basis. This paper shows that WAVinPOD outperforms the other estimators for both synthetically generated signals and particle-based measurements, achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio from a smaller number of samples. The new ﬁltering methodology offers signiﬁcant computational savings, particularly for multi-scale applications seeking to couple continuum informations with atomistic models. It is the ﬁrst time that a rigorous analysis has compared de-noising techniques for particle-based ﬂuid simulations.},

Due to the high degree of the ICA occlusion and the variable ﬂow rate, a transitional and intermittent ﬂow between laminar and turbulent states was established. Time- and space-window proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) was applied to quantify the different ﬂow regimes in the occluded artery. A simpliﬁed version of the POD analysis that utilizes 2D slices only—more appropriate in the clinical setting—was also investigated.},

The criteria to distinguish POD modes representing ensemble average and ﬂuctuation components are based on adaptive examination of eigenvalue decomposition, speciﬁcally on the rate of decay of POD eigenvalues and analysis of POD eigenvectors. The WPOD method is efﬁcient and its superior accuracy leads to smooth ﬁeld gradients that can be used effectively in multiscale formulations. The method has been applied in molecular dynamics and dissipative particle dynamics simulations. We demonstrate the method for several cases including steady and unsteady ﬂow and red blood cell ﬂow, but the same approach can be used in atomistic simulations of materials.},

Further, this paper presents a novel framework for using physics-based loss functions in the learning objective of neural networks, to ensure that the model predictions not only show lower errors on the training set but are also scientiﬁcally consistent with the known physics on the unlabeled set. We illustrate the eﬀectiveness of PGNN for the problem of lake temperature modeling, where physical relationships between the temperature, density, and depth of water are used to design a physicsbased loss function. By using scientiﬁc knowledge to guide the construction and learning of neural networks, we are able to show that the proposed framework ensures better generalizability as well as scientiﬁc consistency of results.},

	abstract = {In typical machine learning tasks and applications, it is necessary to obtain or create large labeled datasets in order to to achieve high performance. Unfortunately, large labeled datasets are not always available and can be expensive to source, creating a bottleneck towards more widely applicable machine learning. The paradigm of weak supervision offers an alternative that allows for integration of domain-speciﬁc knowledge by enforcing constraints that a correct solution to the learning problem will obey over the output space. In this work, we explore the application of this paradigm to 2-D physical systems governed by non-linear differential equations. We demonstrate that knowledge of the partial differential equations governing a system can be encoded into the loss function of a neural network via an appropriately chosen convolutional kernel. We demonstrate this by showing that the steady-state solution to the 2-D heat equation can be learned directly from initial conditions by a convolutional neural network, in the absence of labeled training data. We also extend recent work in the progressive growing of fully convolutional networks to achieve high accuracy ({\textless} 1.5\% error) at multiple scales of the heat-ﬂow problem, including at the very large scale (1024×1024). Finally, we demonstrate that this method can be used to speed up exact calculation of the solution to the differential equations via ﬁnite difference.},

	abstract = {Large-scale atomistic computer simulations of materials heavily rely on interatomic potentials predicting the potential energy and Newtonian forces on atoms. Traditional interatomic potentials are based on physical intuition but contain few adjustable parameters and are usually not accurate. The emerging machinelearning (ML) potentials achieve highly accurate interpolation between the energies in a large DFT database but, being purely mathematical constructions, suﬀer from poor transferability to unknown structures. We propose a new approach that can drastically improve the transferability of ML potentials by informing them of the physical nature of interatomic bonding. This is achieved by combining a rather general physics-based model (analytical bond-order potential) with a neural-network regression. The network adjusts the parameters of the physics-based model on the ﬂy during the simulations according to the local environments of individual atoms. This approach, called the physically-informed neural network (PINN) potential, is demonstrated by developing a general-purpose PINN potential for Al. The potential provides a DFT-level accuracy of energy predictions and excellent agreement with experimental and DFT data for a wide range of physical properties. We suggest that the development of physics-based ML potentials is the most eﬀective way forward in the ﬁeld of atomistic simulations.},

The approach makes use of the current understanding of cellular processes and data from single-particle single-cell imaging experiments. The model reveals two important parameters that characterize viral transport at the population level, namely, the effective velocity, Veff, and the effective diffusion coefﬁcient, Deff. Veff measures virus’s net movement rate and Deff represents the total dispersion rate. We employ the model to study the inﬂuence of microtubule-mediated movements on nuclear targeting and gene expression of adenoviruses of type 2 and type 5 in HeLa and A549 cells. Effects of microtubule organization and the presence of microtubule-destabilizing drugs on viral transport were analyzed and quantiﬁed.

We show that the cell topology (e.g., size, circularity, and dimensionality) strongly inﬂuences the spatiotemporal distribution of gene carriers, and consequently, their optimal intracellular pathways. The model shows that there exists an upper limit on polyplexes’ intracellular delivery efﬁciency due to their inability to protect DNA until nuclear entry. The model predicts that even for optimally designed polyethylenimine vectors, only ;1\% of total DNA is delivered to the nucleus. Based on comparison with gene delivery by viruses, the model suggests possible strategies to signiﬁcantly improve transfection efﬁciencies of synthetic gene vectors.},

	abstract = {Virus traﬃcking is fundamental for infection success, and plasmid cytosolic traﬃcking is a key step of gene delivery. Based on the main physical properties of the cellular transport machinery such as microtubules and motor proteins, our goal here is to derive a mathematical model to study cytoplasmic traﬃcking. Because experimental results reveal that both active and passive movements are necessary for a virus to reach the cell nucleus, by taking into account the complex interactions of the virus with the microtubules, we derive here an estimate of the mean time a virus reaches the nucleus. In particular, we present a mathematical procedure in which the complex viral movement, oscillating between pure diﬀusion and a deterministic movement along microtubules, can be approximated by a steady state stochastic equation with a constant eﬀective drift. An explicit expression for the drift amplitude is given as a function of the real drift, the density of microtubules, and other physical parameters. The present approach can be used to model viral traﬃcking inside the cytoplasm, which is a fundamental step of viral infection, leading to viral replication and, in some cases, to cell damage.},

	abstract = {We present a quasi-steady state reduction of a linear reaction-hyperbolic master equation describing the directed intermittent search for a hidden target by a motor-driven particle moving on a one-dimensional ﬁlament track. The particle is injected at one end of the track and randomly switches between stationary search phases and mobile nonsearch phases that are biased in the anterograde direction. There is a ﬁnite possibility that the particle fails to ﬁnd the target due to an absorbing boundary at the other end of the track. Such a scenario is exempliﬁed by the motor-driven transport of vesicular cargo to synaptic targets located on the axon or dendrites of a neuron. The reduced model is described by a scalar Fokker–Planck (FP) equation, which has an additional inhomogeneous decay term that takes into account absorption by the target. The FP equation is used to compute the probability of ﬁnding the hidden target (hitting probability) and the corresponding conditional mean ﬁrst passage time (MFPT) in terms of the effective drift velocity V , diffusivity D, and target absorption rate λ of the random search. The quasi-steady state reduction determines V , D, and λ in terms of the various biophysical parameters of the underlying motor transport model. We ﬁrst apply our analysis to a simple 3-state model and show that our quasi-steady state reduction yields results that are in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations of the full system under physiologically reasonable conditions. We then consider a more complex multiple motor model of bidirectional transport, in which opposing motors compete in a “tug-of-war”, and use this to explore how ATP concentration might regulate the delivery of cargo to synaptic targets.},

	abstract = {We formulate the ‘tug-of-war’ model of microtubule cargo transport by multiple molecular motors as an intermittent random search for a hidden target. A motor complex consisting of multiple molecular motors with opposing directional preference is modeled using a discrete Markov process. The motors randomly pull each other oﬀ of the microtubule so that the state of the motor complex is determined by the number of bound motors. The tug-of-war model prescribes the state transition rates and corresponding cargo velocities in terms of experimentally measured physical parameters. We add space to the resulting Chapman–Kolmogorov (CK) equation so that we can consider delivery of the cargo to a hidden target at an unknown location along the microtubule track. The target represents some subcellular compartment such as a synapse in a neuron’s dendrites, and target delivery is modeled as a simple absorption process. Using a quasi-steady-state (QSS) reduction technique we calculate analytical approximations of the mean ﬁrst passage time (MFPT) to ﬁnd the target. We show that there exists an optimal adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration that minimizes the MFPT for two diﬀerent cases: (i) the motor complex is composed of equal numbers of kinesin motors bound to two diﬀerent microtubules (symmetric tug-of-war model) and (ii) the motor complex is composed of diﬀerent numbers of kinesin and dynein motors bound to a single microtubule (asymmetric tug-of-war model).},
