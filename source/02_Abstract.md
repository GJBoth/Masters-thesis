Title: Quantifying the Golgi

Abstract: The Golgi apparatus is a key component in intracellular trafficking, maturing and directing proteins essential to the cell. Despite years of research, a model coupling Golgi size and function to the cells' transport properties is lacking. In this thesis we develop such a model, describing the Golgi as an active droplet. New experimental data sheds more insight in the spatial organization of the trafficking and I have also devised two new methods relying on image gradients and neural networks to analyze this data and confront it with our model.
