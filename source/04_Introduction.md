## Golgi as a phase-separated droplet

In no particular order, there's a few notable things about golgi which  warrant a phase separation description:

* The Golgi is able to form de novo (Bevis)
* Microtubules position the golgi near the mtoc (Sengupta)
* Nocadazola depolymerizes microtubules -> golgi stacks move towards ERES (sengupta)
* Golgi size is dependent on amount of trafficking (Sengupta)
* Separate ministacks seems to be fully functional (Wei)
* Golgi disassembly is due to imbalanced trafficking: exit from ER is blocked, while outflow still continues (Ronchi)
* When golgi is completely cut out, stack like structures form around ERES (Ronchi) and then later move towards mtoc. 

We think we can describe this using an active droplet. Our model basically consists of two parts: We hypothesize that we can describe the transport between the ER and the golgi as a advection-diffusion equation and use a Cahn-Hilliard equation (see next section) to describe the phase separation. We thus need a a way to couple the transport model to the phase separation model.
