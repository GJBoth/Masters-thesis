# Introduction

The cell uses thousands of proteins and lipids to function and many of these are produced in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), an organelle found in eukariotic cells. Upon exiting the ER, these proteins and lipids are then transported throughout the cell in a process known as intracellular transport. Key component in this intracellular trafficking is the Golgi apparatus, an organelle responsible for biochemically maturing proteins and directing them to the right location. Intense research over the last years has identified key players, [@emr_journeys_2009],[@tang_cell_2013] but an integrated model coupling Golgi size and function to the intracellular transport is lacking [@rothman_future_2010], [@gosavi_function_2017]. In this thesis, we seek to propose such a model.

Proteins produced in the ER exit the organelle at specific locations referred to as ER Exit Sites - ERES. At these sites, cargo is packaged into a lipid bilayer and this package, known as a vesicle, buds off into the cytoplasm [@budnik_er_2009]. ERES are located throughout the cell and thus the vesicles need to be transported to their destination: the Golgi apparatus. In general, we can recognize two different trafficking modes: diffusive and directive [@bressloff_stochastic_2013]. In the directive mode, molecular motors pull vesicles along microtubules by hydrolysing ATP. Microtubules (MTs) are long tubular polymers spread throughout the cell and form a network which acts as the backbone for intracellular transport. They are organised around objects known as MicroTubular Organisation Centers (MTOCs). The primary MTOC is the centrosome, an organelle located next to the nucleus, but strong evidence exists that the Golgi apparatus acts a MTOC too [@wei_unraveling_2010],[@ronchi_positive_2014]. 

Microtubules are polarized and have two distinct ends, indicated as the (+) and (-). Different molecular motors are utilized for transport towards each end, with dynein being (-)-directed and kinesin (+)-directed [@newby_quasi-steady_2010]. Vesicles are often attached to multiple motors of both types, binding and unbinding constantly, making this active transport a stochastic process which can, for example, be described by a tug-of-war model[@newby_random_2010]. Furthermore, cargo can also completely detach from all molecular motors. The vesicle will then move through the cytoplasm in a diffusive way, until it reattaches to a microtubule. Note that diffusive mode is a deceptively simple name, as the cytoplasm is not a simple fluid; it is packed with other cellular components, giving rise to effects such as anomolous diffusion or crowding. 

The intracellular trafficking transports the vesicles towards the Golgi, where the cargo undergoes biochemical maturation and is sorted before being sent to their destination. The Golgi thus acts as a sort of post-office of the cell, receiving cargo, repackaging and sending it to the right destination [@alberts_molecular_nodate]. Although the function of the Golgi is similar for different cell types, its appearance is strongly dependent on it. In plants for example, the Golgi is distributed throughout the cell in separate but fully functional subunits known as stacks[@staehelin_nanoscale_2008] , whereas in mammals all these stacks are localized close to the nucleus in a single organelle known as the *Golgi Ribbon* [@wei_unraveling_2010]. A stack consists of a number of stacked compartments of a disk-like shape called *cisternae*. These are membrane enclosed objects containing the enzymes responsible for biochemically altering proteins, a process generally referred to as maturing. Proteins move through the Golgi in a particular direction and the Golgi thus has distinct entry and exit faces. These are known respectively as the cis and trans face, with the cisternae being labeled analogously. The cisternae in the middle of the stack are referred to as medial compartments.

At the cis-face vesicles fuse with the golgi and release their cargo into a compartment, while their lipid bilayer becomes part of the compartment membrane. Exactly how maturation then happens is hotly debated [@glick_models_2011], [@griffiths_rubisco_nodate]. The two main competing explanations are the *cisternal maturation* and *vesicular transport* models. In figure [@fig:golgimodels] we show the structure of the Golgi and and a schematic view of each model. In the cisternal maturation model (left panel of @fig:golgimodels), the compartments mature as a whole, changing identity from cis to medial and finally to trans. Trans compartments are recycled into cis compartments by retrograde vesicular transport. In the vesicular transport model (see right panel of @fig:golgimodels), the vesicles move in the opposite direction. Rather than constantly changing identity, in this model cisternae are static entities with a defined task and cargo is moved from one compartment to the next by vesicles. The debate could thus be settled by analysing the direction of the vesicles, but so far this has proven elusive. 

At the trans-face, the cargo is encapsulated again in a lipid bilayer and is transported to its destination, similar to pre-Golgi intracellular transport.

### Quantitative models of the Golgi

The Golgi has been intensively studied by biologists for many years, but very few attempts at quantification appear to have been made: our research only turned up a single attempt by Hirschberg et al [@hirschberg_kinetic_1998], where the authors present a model for the trafficking of VSVG virus from the ER to the plasma membrane. The secretory pathway is modeled by dividing it into populations connected by a first order rate equation, i.e. $d \phi_{2}/dt=k_{1\to2}\phi_{1}$. Assuming no flowback (i.e. $k_{i+1\to i}=0$) and a population for the ER, Golgi and Plasma Membrane, they find that such a model is sufficient to describe their experimental data, as shown in figure #fig:ratemodel.

We reprint their main result in figure [@fig:ratemodel].  Although this model describes the experimental data, it is a phenomological model and reduces the entiry system to a few rate parameters $k_{i\to i+1}$. These rate parameters are not coupled to any of the underlying processes and hence this model doesn't offer any insight into the system. Furthermore, the model lacks any spatial dependence of the concentration.

## This thesis

In this thesis we propose a model which couples intracellular transport to the Golgi. We hypothesize that we can describe the Golgi as an *active, phase separated droplet* and the intracellular transport with an advection-diffusion equation. We will confront our model with experimental data. The group of Frank Perez at Institut Curie has developed a new technique called RUSH[@boncompain_synchronization_2012], which allows us to study the intracellular transport from the ER to the Golgi and beyond using fluorescence microscopy. In the next sections, we justify the description of the Golgi as an active phase-separated droplet and how we intend to perform the data analysis of the experimental data.

### Golgi as an active phase-separated droplet

Many biological processes and reactions require a high concentration of some protein or lipid to occur. This can be achieved by physically separating proteins inside a membrane (consider the lysosome), but the cell contains several membraneless organelles. These organelles thus require a different means of reaching high concentrations and the prime candidate is liquid-liquid phase separation. In this process a mixture of two different liquids A and B separates into two phases, one rich in A and one rich in B, due to the interactions between them. Phase separation can thus produce membraneless domains with a high concentration. It has been proposed as a model for early protocells [@zwicker_growth_2017] and is able to correctly describe several phenomena such as P-granules[@hyman_liquid-liquid_2014] and centrosome growth[@zwicker_centrosomes_2014]. 

We hypothesize we can use a similar description for the Golgi, as its biogenesis contains strong clues which point towards phase separation. First and foremost, the Golgi is able to form *de novo*, meaning that in cells from which the Golgi has been removed, it will reappear without any specific action. Ronchi et al [@ronchi_positive_2014] studied this in detail and found three phases of growth. In the first phase, vesicles are released from the ER, but no larger structures are formed and the vesicles disappear either due to fusion with the ER or degradation. In the second phase larger stack-like structures are formed, while in the third phase all these structures are clustered in a single location; the Golgi Ribbon is formed. Phase two has the markings of a concentration-dependent phase separation. Once a critical concentration is reached, the mixed state becomes unstable and the mixture phase-separates into a dilute and dense phase. The dense phase would then correspond to a stack. 

One crucial point we've neglected so far is that the Golgi isn't a membraneless organelle and neither is the cargo. Hence, a phase-separation description should be inappropriate. Using a description in which we consider the vesicles to be the phase-separating liquid, we think we can use a phase-separation description however. The dense phase would then correspond to the Golgi, while the dilute phase would correspond to the cytoplasm with the vesicles. Such models predict droplets growing to infinity and research has shown that in reality the Golgi has a finite size. By accounting for the maturation of the cargo, making our droplet *active* in the process, finite radii can be obtained. We thus model the Golgi as an *active phase-separated droplet*.

### Biological image analysis

Image analysis is a lively and ongoing subject in cell biology, with many new methods being developed constantly, especially with quantization in mind [@de_vos_seeing_2016], [@hutchison_computational_2014],[@lee_image-based_2015], [@yang_bioimage_2013]. Techniques for quantifying intracellular transport roughly fall into two categories: single particle tracking (SPT) or correlation spectroscopy. SPT tracks fluorescent proteins or beads moving through the cell on a frame-to-frame basis, so that each particle's trajectory can be reconstructed. These trajectories can then be analyzed to obtain information about the transport. The fluorescent movies obtained from the RUSH experiments are not clear enough to accurately localize the vesicles, so that SPT can not be used to analyze the transport. Methods based on correlation spectroscopy [@hebert_spatiotemporal_2005], [@kisley_characterization_2015], [@semrau_particle_2007] rely on a general relationship between the fluctuations and the underlying density of particles and transport properties. These techniques are most suitable for a stationary signal, whereas the RUSH experiments are highly dynamical. Thus, none of the techniques we found are directly applicable to the RUSH data. 

As stated, we hypothesize that we can describe the intracellular process by an advection-diffusion equation and we wish to confront this with the RUSH data. The question we're thus asking is a rather general one: how do we fit some spatiotemporal (nD+1) data to a model? More specifically, since a model is most often presented in the form of a partial differential equation (i.e. $df/dt = \alpha df/dx+\beta d^2f/dx^2+...$), for what parameters $\alpha, \beta...$ is the temporal evolution of a given dataset best described? We have developed and evaluated two different methods. Our first method approaches the problem rather directly by calculating spatial and temporal derivatives directly from the data using a technique known as image gradients. Our second method is based on a recently developed technique based on neural networks [@raissi_physics_2017].  We will show that by encoding physics into the neural network, we are not only able to infer the optimal parameters, but even an optimal parameter *field*.

### Structure and main questions

* **Part I - Model fitting and data analysis**
    * **Chapter 2** introduces the framework we have developed for model fitting spatiotemporal data using image gradients. 
    * **Chapter 3** applies the method developed in chapter 2 to experimental data.
    * **Chapter 4** shows an alternative method for model fitting based on neural networks.
* **Part II - Golgi as an active phase-separated droplet **
    * **Chapter 5** introduces the Cahn-Hilliard equation, which describes phase separation, an approximation of it known as effective droplet theory and develops our model. 
    * **Chapter 6** contains the predictions the model developed in chapter 5 and investigates the biological implications.
* **Chapter 7** is the concluding chapter and summarizes all the findings from the previous chapters.
