# Data analysis

In the previous chapter we developed a general system to fit our advection-diffusion model to the data obtained from the RUSH experiments. In this chapter we apply said system to the MANII movies. MANII has been chosen as after arriving at the Golgi, it remains there. Dealing with only one transport direction makes everything a lot easier for us. This chapter consists of five sections:

* **Section 1** presents a general analysis of the fluorescence data of the movies
* In **section 2** we discuss the time derivative of the fluorescence, $\partial_t I$, as this also has some interesting points.
* **Section 3** contains our analysis of the least squares fit.
* **Section 4** is similar to section 3, only now we analyse a constrained fit with $D>0$.
* **Section 5** summarizes our findings and presents possible improvements for the system.
