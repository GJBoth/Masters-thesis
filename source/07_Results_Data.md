# Data analysis

In this chapter we apply the method developed in the previous chapter to experimental data obtained using the RUSH technique. Our first section introduces the RUSH technique and discusses our model for the intracellular transport. In the following section we discuss the experimental data, investigate the fluorescence curves of several areas of interest. and gain more insight into the data by studying its time derivative. We then present a linear least squares fit and show that this can lead to unphysical results. We end with a short section of both recommendations for the experimentalists as well as a number of ways to improve the method.  

## Experimental data

The transport of vesicles from the ERES to the Golgi is both diffusive and directive and a technique known as RUSH (Retention Using Selective Hooks) has recently been developed [@boncompain_synchronization_2012] in the team of Frank Perez at Institut Curie to study this trafficking. RUSH allows precise timing of the release of proteins from the ER and can be used to follow the secretory pathway from the ER to the Golgi and even post-golgi using fluorescent live-cell imaging. Several other methods have been developed (@presley_er--golgi_1997, @mccaughey_er--golgi_2018), but lack the non-toxicity, timing and versatility of the RUSH technique.

Figure @fig:RUSH shows the principle of the RUSH system. Inside the ER, a core streptavidin is fused to it using a hook protein. Another protein known as a streptavidin-binding-protein (SBP) binds to streptavidin, but connected to the SBP are also the protein to be transported ('reporter') and a fluorescent protein. Upon the addition of biotin, the SBP is released from the streptavidin as the biotin binds to it. The SBP-reporter-fluorescent complex then exits the ER and can be followed the entire secretory pathway with fluorescence microscopy. 

The RUSH technique can be used for many different proteins, but in this thesis we mainly focus on the $\alpha$-mannosidase-II, generally referred to as ManII. The ManII protein resides in the Golgi apparatus and thus upon reaching it will remain there. This means that the data we obtain will only contain transport *towards* the golgi, greatly simplifying the analysis as we won't have to post and pre-golgi traffic. Figure @fig:manII shows two frames in a typical RUSH experiment of ManII trafficking. The left panel shows an image obtained just after the addition of the biotion, so that most of the cargo is still retained in the ER. A later frame is shown on the right: we can observe the localization of fluorescence in the Golgi, while there's still fluorescence in the rest of the cells.

### Model

Vesicles exiting the ERES are transported towards the ER over the microtubules. This is a stochastic process with the proteins detaching from and (re-) attaching to the microtubules randomly, while the vesicles move diffusely once detached. Several models have been developed to describe such intracellular transport processes (@bressloff_stochastic_2013, @holcman_modeling_2007), many in the light of virus trafficking (@lagache_effective_2008, @dinh_model_2005, @brandenburg_virus_2007). In general, these models assume a two population model, with one population being cargo attached to a microtubule and another cargo freely diffusing in the cytoplasm. If one assumes that the timescale for attaching and detaching from the microtubules is much smaller than the transport timescale, the two populations can be assumed to be in equilibrium. In this assumption, known as a quasi-steady-state reduction, the two population model reduces to a Fokker-Planck equation. As the Fokker-Planck equation is functionally equivalent to an advection-diffusion equation, we hypothesize that we can model protein transport using an advection-diffusion equation:
$$
\partial_t c = D\nabla^2c-v\nabla c
$$ {#eq:adeq}
where $c$ is the concentration of the cargo, $D$ a diffusion coefficient and $v$ an advection velocity. Equation @eq:adeq is thus the model we fit our data to. Note that the fluorescence images obtained from the RUSH experiment return an intensity $I$ and not a concentration $c$, and hence we make the assumption $c \propto I$. 

## Initial analysis

We first study the evolution of the fluorescence in two ways, plotting both the mean fluorescence for each frame and the mean fluorescence in the golgi region. To get rid of the background in our statistics, we normalize the fluorescence between before computing the mean. The left panel of frame #fig:fluorescence shows the average fluorescence of each frame and shows a significant drop of almost $30\%$ between the initial and final frame. We observe a strong initial drop and a slower decay after roughly frame 100, which can probably be attributed to photobleaching. The transition between the two decays roughly matches the saturation of the fluorescence in the Golgi (see the right panel), casting strong doubts on our assumption that $c\propto I$. Compensating for this is possible (see @hirschberg_kinetic_1998), but requires significant effort on the experimentalists' part and if the difference between two subsequent frames is small the effect on our fit is neglegible. 

.![left panel: normalized fluorescence. Right panel: fluorescence of three golgis.](source/figures/pdf/general_fluorescence.pdf){#fig:fluorescence}

In the right panel we show the fluorescence in the Golgi ROI for each of the three cells. Specifically, we plot the mean intensity in each ROI, normalized on the maximum intensity and compensated for the loss of fluorescence as shown in the left panel. Interestingly, we observe that all three curves roughly follow a similar pattern. Although one of the cells (blue line) seems to have some sort of delay, the fluorescence seems to increase in a linear way up to frame 100, when the fluorescence saturates. The purple cell shows a significant drop at frame 200, but since the ManII protein remains in the Golgi, this is not caused by any type of intracellular transport and thus not of interest to us. The linear increase and common pattern suggests that the transport properties are not concentration dependent at these concentrations.

To perform our fit in the next section, we have also determined the time derivative of the dataset, $\partial_tI$. We plot this for four different frames in figure @fig:timederiv .

![The determined time derivative four different frames of the ManII RUSH experiments.](source/figures/pdf/time_deriv.pdf){#fig:timederiv}

Areas where the derivative is positive (thus were the concentration increases) are coloured red, while areas where the concentration decreases are coloured blue. As expected, the Golgi shows up in each cell as a bright red object. Note however that we also observe red areas towards the edges of the cell. As the concentration close to the Golgi decreases, the red area moves outwards and slowly takes over the blue area. This could be caused by ERES acting as a in that area, but given that ERES are located throughout the cell it seems more likely such a pattern would be caused by diffusion. 

## Analysis of LS-fit

In this section we analyse results of the least squares fit. We've used a 7x7 window in the spatial domain to perform the sliding window operation, fitting each frame of the movie independently. We analyse the diffusion, advection and the error of our fit. These fits are movies and we're hence unable to print them - please find our these movies at our GitHub. In figure @fig:diff_ls we show two typical inferred diffusion fields in the upper row, just after addition of the biotin (frame 4) and halfway to the complete saturation of the Golgi (frame 40). 

![Analysis of the inferred diffusion field. The upper row shows the inferred field at two frames, while the lower row shows the distribution of values and the fraction of physical values as a function of time.](source/figures/pdf/Diff.pdf){#fig:diff_ls}

Another problem is that we observe many areas with a negative -unphysical- diffusion coefficient. In the lower left panel we plot the distribution of values. Analysis shows that roughly $40\%$ of the inferred field has a negative diffusion coefficient. In the lower right panel we have calculated this fraction as a function of time. It shows that, save for a few initial frames, this fraction is not (strongly) time-dependent. Results are slightly skewed though, since many coefficients are negative but extremely close to zero (e.g $-10^{-4}$). Negative diffusion coefficients correspond to clustering, but could also be the result of an incorrect fit. We investigate this in depth after studying the advection profiles, which we show in figure @fig:advection . In the four panels we show the inferred velocity in the $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$ direction, the magnitude of the velocity and the angle.

![Analysis of the velocity fields. The upper rows show respectively $v_x$ and $v_y$, wwhile the lower row shows the magnitude and angle.](source/figures/pdf/Fit_LSconstrainedadvection.pdf){#fig:advection}

Similar to the diffusion, we observe patterns both in time and space bigger than our fitting window, meaning that the fit isn't completely random. On the other hand, we are not able to discern any specific flow from the figures in @fig:advection. To gain more insight into our fit, we analyze a single pixel in time. Figure @fig:timepixel shows the diffusion and advection velocities as a function of time. We've plotted a scaled and translated signal of that pixel in a black dashed line. This pixel is initially constant and then decreases to noise level. Note that initially, while the signal is constant, the diffusion constant is negative. Once the signal starts decreasing, or, in other words, cargo starts flowing from that pixel, we see a physical diffusion constant and non-zero velocities. Once the signal returns to around noise-level at pixel 50, the inferred velocities and diffusion constant seem to become random around 0. In other words, our method seems to work when cargo is flowing, but struggling when the signal is either constant or at noise level. We observe similar behaviour in other pixels, so we contribute (most of) the unphysical diffusion values to constant and noise-level signal. Performing the fit with the diffusion constant constrained to be larger than zero lead to the negative coefficients in the free fit to being set to zero. 

![Diffusion and advection velocities of a single pixel in time. We've plotted (scaled and translated) signal as a black dashed line to find any correlation.](source/figures/pdf/Fit_LSgeneral_fit.pdf){#fig:timepixel}

This doesn't completely explain the magnitude of the coefficients though, which is significantly lower than expected. One possibility is the 'mixing' of the transport fluorescence with the fluorescence of the ER. After the addition of biotin, the fluorescent cargo gets released, but still has a finite residence time in the ER. Since the obtained images are projected over an axis, changes in fluorescence we observe can be both due to intracellular transport as well as processes inside the ER. If these processes have different timescales, this can strongly affect the inferred coefficients. 

Another possibility is that we've assumed that a concentration of fluorescent particles leads to some sort of 'mean-field' fluorescence which we can describe by an advection-diffusion equation. Once the size of the particles becomes on the order of the pixel size, this assumption breaks down. In the case of the ManII trafficking, the pixels are roughly two to three times the size of a vesicle, meaning that we are at the limits of the 'mean-field' assumption. 

## Conclusion

We've applied the method developed in the previous chapter to the RUSH trafficking data of the ManII protein. Although our fit shows patterns in the coefficient fields larger than our fitting window, pointing at some underlying pattern, we're unable to make any conclusions about our model. It's been shown that the model seems to perform well when the data is transient, i.e. when cargo is actually flowing. However, for most of the time the data is either constant or at noise level, preventing us from making any conclusions. 

Improvements to our method fall roughly into two categories. The first category concerns improvements to the calculation of the derivatives. We've implemented a rather basic 5x5 Sobel filter, but implementing more advanced methods which would result in more accurate derivatives would probably make the biggest improvement. The second category would be improve the fitting procedure. The most obvious candidate is implementing some sort of Bayesian method which would return not just the most probable coefficient, but the entire probability distribution.
